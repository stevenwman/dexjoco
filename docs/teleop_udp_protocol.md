# Dexjoco Teleoperation UDP Protocol

Dexjoco's teleoperation wrappers accept a small UDP protocol so the simulator
can stay decoupled from tracker, glove, or mocap implementations.

## Ports

- `5012`: tracker pose for single-arm and bimanual tasks
- `5014`: right-hand or single-hand joint targets
- `5016`: left-hand joint targets for bimanual tasks

## Tracker Payload

For single-arm teleoperation, port `5012` expects 12 `float64` values laid out
as a row-major `3x4` homogeneous transform:

```text
[r00 r01 r02 tx
 r10 r11 r12 ty
 r20 r21 r22 tz]
```

The simulator reconstructs this into a `4x4` matrix by appending
`[0, 0, 0, 1]`. Dexjoco records the current tracker pose continuously and
starts relative teleoperation when you press `;` in the MuJoCo window.

For bimanual teleoperation, the same port can also receive 24 `float64`
values: the first `3x4` block is the right tracker pose and the second `3x4`
block is the left tracker pose.

## Hand Payload

Ports `5014` and `5016` expect `float64` joint targets.

- Dexjoco reads the first 16 values from each packet.
- Shorter packets are zero-padded.
- Extra values are ignored.

The single-arm wrapper reads only `5014`. The bimanual wrapper reads `5014`
for the right hand and `5016` for the left hand.

## Local Controls

- `;`: toggle teleoperation on or off
- `R`: drop the current trajectory and request a reset
