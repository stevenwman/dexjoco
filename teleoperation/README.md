## Teleoperation Providers

This directory contains optional teleoperation providers that can publish UDP
messages for Dexjoco's simulated data-collection pipeline.

- `vive_bridge/`: Dexjoco-maintained OpenVR sender for Vive tracker poses.
- `rokoko/`: Dexjoco-maintained Rokoko Studio bridge for forwarding
  canonicalized hand keypoints from another PC to the GeoRT/Dexjoco stack.
- `GeoRT/`: third-party hand-retargeting component kept in-repo for
  non-commercial research use. This directory keeps its own upstream license
  and includes Dexjoco-specific Rokoko/UDP adaptations.

Dexjoco's simulation collector only depends on the UDP payloads documented in
[`../docs/teleop_udp_protocol.md`](../docs/teleop_udp_protocol.md). The
providers in this directory are optional helpers around that protocol.
